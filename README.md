# Face-Detection
**Define** the libraries needed by **CV2 and SYS**. **Define** a variable to count the number of presences in the image. **Defining** a variable for the possibility of determining the face in the form of a square. Variable definition of the ability to take pictures when I play the video through the webcam. As long as the above variables are **actual**, I will do the following:
 **Read** the face frames in the video image. **Set** the frame color to gray.
**Define** a function to define the face and specify the variables I need: **color**, **frame size**.
**Define** a For loop to determine the face in the form of a rectangle every time the program notices the presence of a face in the image for all successive frames. **Show window results.** **Delay of milliseconds** and this delay is always positive for all video frames.
**Finally,** if everything is as it should be there is a video and a picture of the face was taken in this video  One condition is included for the video from which frames are taken. **close all the windows that we have created.**
